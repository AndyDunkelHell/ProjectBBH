In this folder a code to test all the Servos manually can be found. It is a variation of the code found in my StepperController-Python repo. If you want to find out more on how this works please refer to the Repository. It is important to adjust the COM Port and the Baudrate of the connected board on the [`Python`](/Python/) script in order for it to work.
