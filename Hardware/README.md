# Modular 3D-Printable Bionic Hand

## Overview
For this project a modular 3D-printable bionic hand was designed, emphasizing the balance between structural complexity and functionality. The design achieves a high degree of dexterity by incorporating 20 degrees of freedom (DOFs) across all fingers, including the thumb, through the use of 16 actuators.

## Hardware Design

### Modular 3D-Printable Design
The components of the bionic hand are designed for 3D printing, facilitating easy replication and assembly. The design's modularity allows for the replacement or upgrading of parts without requiring a complete rebuild. Special attention was given to the actuators' arrangement to mimic the natural movement of human joints, with a specific focus on the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints.

#### Actuators and Degrees of Freedom
The design strategically uses servo motors to actuate one or two DOFs, optimizing the hand's functionality while minimizing its complexity. A notable feature is the coupling of the PIP and DIP joints to reduce the number of required actuators, a decision supported by their similar behavior during movement.

#### 3D-Printed Structures
- **Basic Interphalangeal (BIP)**: A structure designed for the flexion and extension of interphalangeal joints, utilizing a braided polyethylene fishing line for its strength and thinness.
- **Lateral Metacarpal (LMCP)**: Replicates the condyloid joints, allowing for the abduction and adduction movements of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints.
- **Rotating Metacarpal (RMCP)**: Specifically designed for the thumb, this structure enables semicircular movement, reflecting the saddle joint's functionality.

### Integration and Assembly
The design incorporates 3D-printed covers for aesthetic purposes, hiding the mechanical components while ensuring the hand's realistic appearance. An assembly for mounting the actuators within the palm and forearm optimizes the prosthetic hand's form factor and structural integrity.

### Control System
An auxiliary 3D-printed part hosts surface electrodes, ensuring consistent data acquisition for controlling the bionic hand. These parts are integrated into a fabric mesh for ease of use and comfort during daily wear.
